He pulls a long blade out of his coat and before you can even let out a scream, you feel warm liquid pooling around your neck, then the pain. The cut wasn’t deep enough, he’s playing with you. You start to struggle trying to get out from under him but you have no energy left. Finally he lifts the blade again and holds it over your heart.

Within seconds, you feel something sharp pierce your stomach and something wet causing your shirt to stick to your skin. Looking up, you see a hooded man shrouded in shadow, he pulls you into an embrace as everything around you fades to darkness.',
   'Enter the room next to it.': 'You decide the room is a trap and try heading into the one next to it. Inside is another door with another lock. You sigh as you prepare to answer another riddle. Maybe its time to give up.',
    'Turn around completely.': 'The vibes in this hallway seem terrible, and you cannot stop shaking. You decide that turning around completely seems like the best option. Maybe checking the doors you skipped previously will take you closer to the exit?',
    'wood':'Thinking staying as quiet as possible is better, you try to pry the wood open with your bare hands. Covered in splinters, you do not give up, you cannot, not when you are this close to being free, to getting out of this nightmare of a situation you were placed in. You do not deserve to die like this. Full of emotion, you begin kicking the wood as hard as you can, and it slowly starts to snap. Finally, the hole is big enough for you to crawl out of. You did it. You escaped. As you lay on the ground in front of the hole, a few minutes later bystanders start to pass by. You begin to sob as you hear someone calling the police. A kind woman approaches you and helps you stand up. You are saved.',
    'scream': 'Feeling a rush of adrenaline, you begin to scream, you scream as loud as you can, begging for someone to help you. You continue to crawl towards the wood and get ready to pry it open when suddenly, you feel something tug on your leg. Your pants probably got caught on something. Don’t think about it; you are almost free. The tugging gets stronger and more frequent as you try to move forward. Stopping in your tracks, you slowly turn your head and tilt your head up. Behind you is a hooded man dressed head to toe in black. You try to kick him, but it’s too late. Glancing at his hand, you notice a large axe. He swings it up, and it lands in your right calf. You are not going anywhere. As you scream in pain, he begins to drag you backwards. Back to the tiny door you escaped from. Grabbing onto anything you can, trying to stop his movement, you see the light from the outside world slowly fading, the sounds of life getting further and further. I guess you should not have gotten your hopes up.'
